      "\t-6.659\t﻿ISo this is where the children come to die,hidden on the hospital’s highest floor.They wear their bandages like uniformsand pull their iv rigs along the hall with slow and careful steps. Or bald and pale,they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,watching another world on a screen.The mothers spend their nights inside the ward,sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,too small to lie in comfort. Soon they slipbeside their children, as if they might meshthose small bruised bodies back into their flesh.Instinctively they feel that love so strongprotects a child. Each morning proves them wrong.No one chooses to be here. We play the partsthat we are given—horrible as they are.We try to play them well, whatever that means.We need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.The doctors come and go like oracles,their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.There is a word that no one ever speaks. II I put this poem aside twelve years agobecause I could not bear remembering the faces it evoked, and every lineseemed—still seems—so inadequate and grim.What right had I, whose son had walked away, to speak for those who died? And I’ll admitI wanted to forget. I’d lost one childand couldn’t bear to watch another die.Not just the silent boy who shared our room,but even the bird-thin figures dimly glimpsedshuffling deliberately, disjointedlylike ancient soldiers after a parade.Whatever strength the task required I lacked. No well-stitched words could suture shut these wounds. And so I stopped...But there are poems we do not choose to write. III The children visit me, not just in dream,appearing suddenly, silently—insistent, unprovoked, unwelcome.They’ve taken off their milky bandagesto show the raw, red lesions they still bear.Risen they are healed but not made whole.A few I recognize, untouched by years.I cannot name them—their faces pale and graylike ashes fallen from a distant fire.What use am I to them, almost a stranger?I cannot wake them from their satin beds.Why do they seek me? They never speak.And vagrant sorrow cannot bless the dead\n",
      "\t-6.915\tDeath is a funny thing. Most people are afraid of it, and yet they don't even know what it is. Perhaps we can clear this up. What is death? Death is it. That's it. Finished. \"Finito.\" Over and out. No more. Death is many different things to many different people. I think it is safe to say, however, that most people don't like it. Why? Because they are afraid of it. Why are they afraid of it? Because they don't understand it. I think that the best way to try to understand death is to think about it a lot. Try to come to terms with it. Try to really understand it. Give it a chance! Sometimes it helps if we try to visualize things. Try to visualize, for example, someone sneaking up behind your back and hitting you over the head with a giant hammer. Some people prefer to think of death as a more spiritual thing. Where the soul somehow separates itself from the mess and goes on living forever somewhere else. Heaven and hell being the most traditional choices. Death has a very black reputation but, actually, to die is a perfectly normal thing to do. And it's so wholesome: being a very important part of nature's big picture. Trees die, don't they? And flowers? I think it's always nice to know that you are not alone. Even in death. Let's think about ants for a minute. Millions of ants die every day, and do we care? No. And I'm sure that ants feel the same way about us. But suppose—just suppose—that we didn't have to die. That wouldn't be so great either. If a 90-year-old man can hardly stand up, can you imagine what it would be like to be 500 years old? Another comforting thought about death is that 80 years or so after you die nobody who knew you will still be alive to miss you. And after you're dead, you won't even know it\n",
      "\t-7.188\tOn Death's domain intent I fix my eyes, Where human nature in vast ruin lies, With pensive mind I search the drear abode, Where the great conqu'ror has his spoils bestow'd; There there the offspring of six thousand years In endless numbers to my view appears: Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are thrust, And nations mix with their primeval dust: Insatiate still he gluts the ample tomb; His is the present, his the age to come See here a brother, here a sister spread, And a sweet daughter mingled with the dead. But, Madam, let your grief be laid aside, And let the fountain of your tears be dry'd, In vain they flow to wet the dusty plain, Your sighs are wafted to the skies in vain, Your pains they witness, but they can no more, While Death reigns tyrant o'er this mortal shore. The glowing stars and silver queen of light At last must perish in the gloom of night: Resign thy friends to that Almighty hand, Which gave them life, and bow to his command; Thine Avis give without a murm'ring heart, Though half thy soul be fated to depart. To shining guards consign thine infant care To waft triumphant through the seas of air: Her soul enlarg'd to heav'nly pleasure springs, She feeds on truth and uncreated things. Methinks I hear her in the realms above, And leaning forward with a filial love, Invite you there to share immortal bliss Unknown, untasted in a state like this. With tow'ring hopes, and growing grace arise, And seek beatitude beyond the skies\n",

      "\t-7.202\t———A simple Child, That lightly draws its breath, And feels its life in every limb, What should it know of death? I met a little cottage Girl: She was eight years old, she said; Her hair was thick with many a curl That clustered round her head. She had a rustic, woodland air, And she was wildly clad: Her eyes were fair, and very fair; —Her beauty made me glad. “Sisters and brothers, little Maid, How many may you be?” “How many? Seven in all,” she said, And wondering looked at me. “And where are they? I pray you tell.” She answered, “Seven are we; And two of us at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea. “Two of us in the church-yard lie, My sister and my brother; And, in the church-yard cottage, I Dwell near them with my mother.” “You say that two at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea, Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be.” Then did the little Maid reply, “Seven boys and girls are we; Two of us in the church-yard lie, Beneath the church-yard tree.” “You run about, my little Maid, Your limbs they are alive; If two are in the church-yard laid, Then ye are only five.” “Their graves are green, they may be seen,” The little Maid replied, “Twelve steps or more from my mother’s door, And they are side by side. “My stockings there I often knit, My kerchief there I hem; And there upon the ground I sit, And sing a song to them. “And often after sun-set, Sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer, And eat my supper there. “The first that died was sister Jane; In bed she moaning lay, Till God released her of her pain; And then she went away. “So in the church-yard she was laid; And, when the grass was dry, Together round her grave we played, My brother John and I. “And when the ground was white with snow, And I could run and slide, My brother John was forced to go, And he lies by her side.” “How many are you, then,” said I, “If they two are in heaven?” Quick was the little Maid’s reply, “O Master! we are seven.” “But they are dead; those two are dead! Their spirits are in heaven!” ’Twas throwing words away; for still The little Maid would have her will, And said, “Nay, we are seven!”\n",
      "\t-7.869\tThere is another world, but it is in this one. Paul Eluard First there were those who died before I was born. It was as if they had just left and their shadows would slip out after them under the door so recently closed the air in its path was still swirling to rest. Some of the furniture came from them, I was told, and one day I opened two chests of drawers to learn what the dead kept. But it was when I learned to read that I began always to live among the dead. I remember Rapunzel, the improved animals in the Just-So Stories, and a flock of birds that saved themselves from a hunter by flying in place in the shape of a tree, their wings imitating the whisk of wind in the leaves. My sons and I are like some wine the dead have already bottled. They wish us well, but there is nothing they can do for us. Sebastian cries in his sleep, I bring him into my bed, talk to him, rub his back. To help his sons live easily among the dead is a father’s great work. Now Sebastian drifts, soon he’ll sleep. We can almost hear the dead breathing. They sound like water under a ship at sea. To love the dead is easy. They are final, perfect. But to love a child is sometimes to fail at love while the dead look on with their abstract sorrow. To love a child is to turn away from the patient dead. It is to sleep carefully in case he cries. Later, when my sons are grown among their own dead, I can dive easily into sleep and loll among the coral of my dreams growing on themselves until at the end I almost never dream of anyone, except my sons, who is still alive\n"

There are so many foreigners here, I said, when I first stepped onto a beach in Virginia. I had an idea of the ocean, and of who I was. I am in water now, attempting to see the ocean. We lick our wounds with the same tongue. Long accustomed to carrying a gauze for shield, the heart wraps bruises like dumplings. I see the sun through my neighbour's window, whelked in lace. Is this what we mean when we use the word \"virtual\"? Tulips grow even after they're cut. The ones I loved, having died without returning, crowd the heart's waiting room. To start all over again is to imagine the world is, as it is. I give up; I thought this was a poem about nation, the one she began at nineteen. The one she waits to return to: her eyes never adjusting to the colors of exile. This antechamber; this long incision called hope. Last night I crossed to the other side, unwelcome territory. I might have been sad. My broke heart. I'd been observing then, the sun's influence, subjugated by streetlights imitating moonlight. Even the sun softens, (I had thought to myself) to bring every image in view as a memory of some other place, some other text. Last night, I slept in a borrowed bed for guests I anticipated, as host to self's solitary marriage. I examined the world, thus altered. Later, standing at the precipice, I awoke. Even sleep did not take me back. And the signal—being green—I walked\n",

I thought it was a chance to do something I hadn’t done, and so I signed up for an introductory poetry course on a Massive Open Online Course because I am a beginner at poetry and am a good self­-learner. The course reached out to me: Start learning today by watching your first video: watch a video on Emily Dickinson’s “I dwell in Possibility.” I was not sure whether my residence was possibility. My chamber, upstairs, has two windows—one of them offers a view of the magnolia tree in the garden below; its thousands of purple and white shapes loom up toward me, with a perfect curve for the blue sky. I counted the flowers in the tree. Watching the light accumulating in the tree was the only thing I could do at the time. I was subtracted from the world. I saw light as not a form but life; light not a concept but a rhythm. Light not understanding but inspiration after all. Every moment big bees in wrappers of purple and white\n",

I was going as I came, the words move through my limbs, lungs, mouth, as I appear to sitpeacefully at your hearth transubstantiating some wine. It was a rough red, it was one of those nights we were notforced by circumstances to drink wine out of mugs.Circumstances being, in those cases, no one had beentransfixed at the kitchen sink long enough to wash dishes. I brought armfuls of wood from the splitting stump.Many of them, because it was cold, went right on top of their recent ancestors. It was an ice night.They transpired visibly, resin to spark, bark to smoke, wood to ash. I wastransgendering and drinking the rough red at roughly the same rate and everyone who looked, saw.The translucence of flames beat against the air against our skins. This can be done withor without clothes on. This can be done with or without wine or whiskey but never without water:evaporation is also ongoing.
